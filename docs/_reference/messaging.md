    output: A redux-saga [Channel](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/docs/advanced/Channels.html) which emits for every message received.
    example: |
      ```js
      function* readMessages() {
        const channel = rsf.messaging.channel();

        while(true) {
          const message = yield take(channel);

  - signature: messaging.syncMessages(options)
    id: syncMessages
    generator: true
    description: Automatically dispatches a redux action every time a new message is received.
    arguments:
      - name: options
        required: true
        type: Object
        description: "An object to configure how the messages should be synchronised. It must contain at least the `successActionCreator` which must take a new message as a single argument. The other possible options are `failureActionCreator` which is called on channel errors and `transform` which is an optional transformer function to be applied to the value before it's passed to the action creator. Default to the identity function (`x => x`)."
    output:
    example: |
      ```js
      import { showMessage } from '../actionCreators/messaging';

      function* notificationsRootSaga() {
        yield [

        description: "An object to configure how the token should be synchronised. It must contain at least the `successActionCreator` which must take a single argument being the new registration token.
